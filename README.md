# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Hey! Iâ€™m a passionate developer who loves building things that feel good to use. Whether itâ€™s crafting sleek mobile interfaces with React Native or diving deep into full-stack functionality, I enjoy the balance between creativity and logic that development brings.

I'm currently working on projects that blend design, audio, and real-time interaction â€” like music players, civic apps, and tools that connect people in meaningful ways.

Outside of code, youâ€™ll probably find me exploring new tech, tweaking UI animations, or vibing to my favorite playlists while shipping commits.

Always learning. Always building. Letâ€™s create something awesome together.
